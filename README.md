Summary
===================
This is a **VC++** repository with my personal solutions to exercise questions from [Cracking The coding Interview 6th Edition](http://a.co/5vG9JHu). Exercise categories are separated by Solution projects. The exercises are run by a unit test within the solution.

Requirements
-------------
 - Visual Studio 2019
 - Patience 
 
How to use
-------------
 - Read code stuff by opening the code files (derp) and _get learned_.
 - [Build the entire solution](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5tdasz7h.aspx) **before** [running the unit tests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh270865.aspx#Anchor_2).
	 - You may also use hand-acrobatics: **Ctrl+Shift+B**, then **Ctrl+R**, then **A**.
